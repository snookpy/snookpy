# Hi, I am Nook 👋
I’m a full-stack developer I can do just about anything, like a duck 🐣

I have experience in researching and developing backend applications such as microservices, web service APIs, cloud computing, and CI/CD. 

On the frontend, I’ve worked with full postback websites (MVC), modern frameworks like React.js and Angular, and mobile frontends using React Native and Flutter.

## Tech Stack
I’ve got experience with a wide range of tools and technologies.

### Backend
Most of my backend work supports full application layers alongside frontend development.

- Node.js
- DOTNET C#

### Frontend
I’ve built full postback MVC apps as well as modern frontend applications. For modern frontend projects, I usually include unit tests. since today’s frontend frameworks are easy to start but hard to maintain.

- Pure JavaScript, jQuery
- React.js, React Native
- Angular
- Flutter
- TypeScript

### Database
I’m familiar with relational databases and have solid SQL skills. I’ve also worked with some non-relational databases.

- SQL Server
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL

### Other Tools
These are my go-to tools in almost every project:

- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Travis CI
- Docker
- Linux
